# FizzBuzz Challenge
# The goal is to write a program that iterates through numbers from 1 to a specified limit. For each number, it should follow these rules:
# If the number is a multiple of 3, output "Fizz".
# If the number is a multiple of 5, output "Buzz".
# If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, output "FizzBuzz".
# Otherwise, if the number is not a multiple of 3 or 5, output the number itself.
